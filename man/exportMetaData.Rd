\item{fields}{A character vector of field names for which the metadata is to 
be retrieved.}

\item{forms}{A character vector of forms for which the metadata is to be

\description{

levels of factors, apply labels, and other data management tasks once the 
data are retrieved
}
\details{
A record of this export is placed in the REDCap logging page, 
but the file that is exported is not stored in the database.

This function allows you to export the metadata for a project

\section{REDCap Version}{

5.8.2+ (and earlier, but we don't know how much earlier)
}

\section{Known REDCap Limitations}{
 
The API doesn't respond to the \code{fields} and \code{forms} arguments.  It
always returns the full data dictionary.
